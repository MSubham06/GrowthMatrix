## 🎨 Brand Identity & Color Palette

The **GrowthMatrix** demo utilizes the "Executive Look" theme. This palette is designed to convey trust, authority, and high-end consulting services, heavily relying on strong dark tones and premium metallic accents.

### Color Codes

* **Cream / Off-White:** `#EFE8CE` (Use for soft backgrounds)
* **Soft Gold:** `#F2C95B` (Use for secondary accents and highlights)
* **Bronze / Orange:** `#E59145` (Use for Primary Call-to-Action buttons)
* **Dark Slate:** `#3A4A5A` (Use for secondary text or footer sections)
* **Charcoal Black:** `#42474A` (Use for primary headings and base backgrounds)
* **Crisp White:** `#FFFFFF` (Use for clean section backgrounds and high-contrast text)

### Typography

The typography pairs a bold, authoritative Serif font for headings with a highly legible, clean Sans-Serif for the body text. This creates a high-end, classic consulting vibe while maintaining modern web readability.

* **Primary Font (Headings):** `Playfair Display` (Serif) - Used for Hero text, section titles, and strong calls to action.
* **Secondary Font (Body Text):** `Inter` (Sans-Serif) - Used for paragraphs, descriptions, and UI elements.
